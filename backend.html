<h2>ROR vs. NODE.js</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
When you pick between the two platforms, the main points you should consider are the development speed you need, and the server performance parameters. 
Are you running lots of simple, concurrent requests through the application? 
Or more complex, CPU intensive requests?
Go with Node.js for concurrency, and Ruby on Rails for CPU intensive applications.</li>
<li>
Finally, we strongly suggest that, when using Ruby on Rails, you install the tools required for building Ruby gems components. 
In order to easily and quickly facilitate a Ruby gem installation. 
These components let you relax and forget about the decency difficulties that users often experience with Ruby. 
Because our bundled tools automatically resolve dependencies for you.

<h2>ROR vs. DJANGO</h2>
Both Ruby On Rails vs Django provide benefits stemming out of their core principles, assisting the developer to focus on business logic. 
Project requirements, the developerâ€™s skill and efficiency within the chosen language are some of the key factors which would decide the framework. 
Anyone prefer to get the biggest details out of the way first, should go with Django. 
But when it comes to quick launch and worry about the details later, then Rails would do better. 
Automation and shortcut feature in Rails would assist to implement a complex feature.<br/>
